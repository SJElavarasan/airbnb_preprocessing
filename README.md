# Airbnb Data Preprocessing

## Overview
This project focuses on preprocessing Airbnb dataset to prepare it for analysis or modeling. The preprocessing steps include cleaning, transforming, and filtering the dataset to make it suitable for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains Airbnb listings information, including property details, host information, pricing, availability, and reviews. It may include data from multiple cities or regions.

## Preprocessing Steps
The preprocessing steps performed on the Airbnb dataset include:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling or normalization
- Feature engineering (if applicable)
- Handling outliers (if applicable)
- Data splitting (for training and testing)

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing steps.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing tasks.
- `results/`: Generated preprocessed dataset files or summary reports.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/elaavs1997@gamil.com/airbnb-preprocessing.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
 cd airbnb-preprocessing
3. Run the preprocessing scripts or explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the preprocessing steps.

4. Use the preprocessed dataset for analysis, visualization, or machine learning tasks.
